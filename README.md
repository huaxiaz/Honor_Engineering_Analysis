# Honor_Engineering_Analysis
This repository organizes the course materials I am teaching at Northwestern University (Fall 2024). The course is designed for Engineering first-year undergraduate students to learn about linear algebra and its applications (Honor Level). Please note the materials are revised by myself with an emphasis on [**Python (Anaconda Distribution)**](https://www.anaconda.com/download), so they are not exactly the same as the [original course]((https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/academics/courses/descriptions/206-EA-1.html)) materials (The course is taught with an emphasis on [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) implementation).

- Python_basics Folder
  - Python_JupyterNotebook: this tutorial notebook provides a quick overview to Python programming. If you're new to programming, this is the perfect starting point.
  - NumPy_Matrix: this tutorial notebook covers essential concepts from Linear Algebra  (Chapter 1-4 from ***Linear Algebra and its Applications (5th Edition)***) and demonstrates the implementation using [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org).
  - NumPy_Vector: this tutorial notebook covers essential concepts from Vector Analysis (Chapter 6 from ***Linear Algebra and its Applications (5th Edition)***) and demonstrates the implementation using [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org).

- Case_studies Folder
  - Graph_PageRank: this notebook covers basics about graph powered by [**NetworkX**](https://networkx.org) and PageRank Algorithm (Case Study 1 & Week 1).
  - Random_Graph: this notebook covers degree distributions of graphs and different types of random graphs (Week 2).
  - Iterative_methods: this notebook covers two common iterative algorithms (Week 3).
  - Complex_dynamics:  this notebook covers an overview of complex numbers and complex dynamics (fractals) (Week 4).

- Further_reading Folder: this folder contains a markdown file that primarily lists journal publications in the relevant research areas related to the topics in Case Studies.
