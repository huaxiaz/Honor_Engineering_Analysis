# Honor_Engineering_Analysis
This repository organizes the course materials I am teaching at Northwestern University (Fall 2024). The course is designed for Engineering first-year undergraduate students to learn about linear algebra and its applications (Honor Level). Please note the materials are revised by myself in [**Python (Anaconda Distribution)**](https://www.anaconda.com/download), so they are not exactly the same as the original course materials (The course is taught with [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) implementation). 

- Python_JupyterNotebook: this section provides a quick overview to Python programming. If you're new to programming, this is the perfect starting point.
- NumPy_Matrix: this section covers essential concepts from Linear Algebra  (Chapter 1-4 from ***Linear Algebra and its Applications (5th Edition)***) and demonstrates their implementation using NumPy.
- Graph_PageRank: this section covers basics about Graph powered by NetworkX and PageRank Algorithm (Case Study 1).
