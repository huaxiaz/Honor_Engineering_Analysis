# Honor_Engineering_Analysis
This repository organizes the course materials I am teaching at Northwestern University (Fall 2024). The course is designed for Engineering first-year undergraduate students to learn about linear algebra and its applications (Honor Level). Please note the materials are revised by myself in **Python**, so they are not exactly the same as the original course materials (The course is taught with **MATLAB**).
